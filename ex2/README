FILES:
Thread.c -- a file with some code
Thread.h -- a file with some headers
ReadyQueue.c -- a file with some code
ReadyQueue.h -- a file with some headers
uthreads.c -- a file with some code
uthreads.h -- a file with some headers

REMARKS:
In the file Thread.h i didn't know what to do with the fields "env" and "translate_address",
if to put them in public members or in private. I looked all over the class presentations,
but i couldn't find an answer. So eventialy i decided to put them in the public members 
group, hope its not a mistake.

ANSWERS:

	question 1 - 
RR pros:	- insure that all threads will run.
		- every thread gets same opportunity to run - doesn't metter who's more importent.
RR cons:	- can be that very importent threads will'nt get the chance to run.
PQ pros:	- insure that the most importent threads will run first.
PQ cons:	- can be that not all threads will run.

	question 2 - 
One exemple i can think about its the event of read and write. When file need to be read, 
and need to be blocked while some user write on him.
